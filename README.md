This repository contains the code of the Web Applications which demonstrate the applications of the generative hydrological models. 

The methods to develop generative hydrological models are described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09904).

The Web Applications can be found in the following links:
1. Generating hydrological model instances for hydrological predictions: https://generative-hydrological-prediction.streamlit.app/
2. Search the optimal model instances -- hydrological model calibration: https://generative-hydrological-calibration.streamlit.app/.
